# Lab 01 Signals as Waves / Signal Construction

## What is a signal
A Signal is a measurable, time-varying physical disturbance -- EM or mechanical -- that propagates through space or medium, encoding information

## Signal Format
`s(t) = A*sin(2*pi*w*t + phi)`  
where:
* A = amplitude
* w = freqeuncy of tone
* phi = offset of signal
